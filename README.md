  This research project proposes an innovative approach to audio classification in
the realm of machine learning security, focusing on the classification of audio data
within an encrypted domain. The central concept is to treat audio signals as visual
data by converting them into spectrograms, thus encapsulating their amplitude,
pitch, and frequency characteristics. This novel method lays the groundwork for
an Imagebased Encrypted Audio Classification using Convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNN), a pioneering concept that merges the efficiency of image-based
networks with audio classification in an encrypted environment.The study lever-
ages the CryptoDL framework, enabling the deployment of deep neural networks
on encrypted data, which ensures the privacy of sensitive information
